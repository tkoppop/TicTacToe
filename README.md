# TicTacToe

A simple TicTacToe game with winning conditions and everything. The Java Script Version is live at http://127.0.0.1:5500/Java%20Script%20Version/index.html, and features player versus player interactions. The Java version is a player versus computer setup where the computer gets first move, and will never lose (unless you are good enough :D). Good Luck and have fun!
